## RabbitMQ Output Plugin's Source Has Moved

This RabbitMQ Output Plugin is now a part of the [RabbitMQ Integration Plugin][integration-source];
this project remains open for backports of fixes from that project to the 6.x series where possible, but pull-requests should first be made on the [integration plugin][integration-pull-requests].

If you have already made commits on a clone of this stand-alone repository, it's ok! Go ahead and open the Pull Request here, and open an Issue linking to it on the [integration plugin][integration-issues] -- we'll work with you to sort it all out and to get the backport applied.
